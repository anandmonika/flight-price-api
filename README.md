### Flight price API

This will be using skyscanner API to fetch the prices between two locations

* Assumptions *

- API `/price` will take three parameters source, destination and date
- `source` and `destination` params should be the iata code eg: DEL for Delhi
- `date` is expected `YYYY-MM-DD` format
